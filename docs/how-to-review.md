# Reviewing applications

Providing your feedback and vote on each application is easy once you are familiar with the system. With just a few clicks your feedback will be stored and ready for the system administrator to start tallying.      

## Starting a review

Once you open an application from the main listings screen you will notice a new blue button in the upper right-hand corner of your screen that says "+Review". Clicking this will open your feedback for the application you currently have open. There are three different inputs you can offer:

* **Decision** - This is a mandatory field and is your vote on whether or not you feel this application should be funded. You may select "Yes", "No", or "Abstain". Abstain should only be selected if you have a conflict of interest in voting for this application. The results of this field are what the administrator will use to tally votes. 
* **Comments** - This optional field can be used to store commentary or notes you have during your review process. It is especially useful when you plan to return and finish a review later.


## Saving a review in progress

If you are in the process of reviewing an application and not ready to submit your decision, the system features a "Save Draft" button. Clicking this will save any information you have entered into the current review form. 

## Submitting a review

When you are satisfied with your decision and have entered any commentary you feel is necessary, submitting your review by clicking the "Submit". At this point, your feedback will be stored in the system and you can review the next application.

## Switching between applications

To switch between applications you must return to the main application listing page. There are two ways to do this:

* Click the logo at the top of the page
* Click the link that says "Listings"

## Changing a review

If you decide to change your decision after submitting your feedback, all you need to do is navigate to the application you wish to change the feedback on and open the review form with the blue "+Review" button. Once you are satisfied with your input, click the "Submit" again to update the form.
