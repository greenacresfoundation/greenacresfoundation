# Reviewing applications

Providing your feedback and vote on each application is easy once you are familiar with the system. With just a few clicks your feedback will be stored and ready for the system administrator to start tallying.      

## Starting a review

Once you open an application from the main listings screen you will notice a new blue button in the upper right-hand corner of your screen that says "+Review". Clicking this will open your feedback for the application you currently have open. There are three different inputs you can offer:

* **Decision** - This is a mandatory field and is your vote on whether or not you feel this application should be funded. You may select "Yes", "No", or "Abstain". Abstain should only be selected if you have a conflict of interest in voting for this application. The results of this field are what the administrator will use to tally votes. 
* **Comments** - This is an optional field and can be used to start
